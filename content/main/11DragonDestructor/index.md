# Brief

A small game where the objective is to reach a certain height in the Y Axis while spawning physics objects, there are two players and each one can spawn blocsk with a joystick until they reach the given objective height.

It uses the physic engine called "Box2D" and emphasizes on the database saving of the physics world and textures of the game whilst retaining 4 save slots and the possibility to load them in runtime.

Project was done by Ivan Ivanov Mandev and Alvaro Soriano Romero.
