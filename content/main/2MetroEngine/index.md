# Brief

Metro Engine is our Engine Programming subject final project.

Credits to all asset makers, especially to [Jose Garc√≠a](https://www.artstation.com/jgarciacliment). 

This video shows the main features of the engine running on PC and PS4.
The PC version uses OpenGL as its graphics API.

The main features are:
- Pseudo-data-oriented design (ECS).
- Multithreading.
- Deferred rendering.
- Physically Based Rendering.
- Image-Based Lighting.
- Intuitive and useful UI integration with ImGui.
- LUA as the scripting language for the simulation loop of the app. (Play/Stop functionality). Scripts must have BeginPlay() and Update().
- Wavefront OBJ loading (with sub geometries handling and materials)
- Post-processing: Tone-mapping.

This project was developed by:

- Alvaro Soriaon Romero.
- Ivan Ivanov Mandev.

You can check the **in-depth** explanations on how the engine was built on the PC version in this website: [metro-engine.github.io](https://metro-engine.github.io/)
