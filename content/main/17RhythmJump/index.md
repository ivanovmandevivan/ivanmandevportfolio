# Brief

A small unity game where the main focus is on the effects, the rhythm and the jumping of the player through the obstacles that go with the music.

An algorithm called "Blackman" was used to individually sample the songs and to place obstacles and synchronize the effects with the different songs that we have in the game.

 ! Some of the songs might be muted due to copyright strikes to the video.

Project was done by Ivan Ivanov Mandev , Nacho González-Herrero Ruiz de Eguílaz and Juan Carlos Ten.
